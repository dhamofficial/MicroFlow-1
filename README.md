# MicroFlow

This a multi-purpose personal playground to experiment and have as a reference for new projects.

I intend to use this as a repo for whatever I discover somehow to be a "best practice", or decide by my own it's one of them.

## Background

I had the honor to produce the Spanish translation of the e-book [.NET Microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications](https://aka.ms/microservicesebook) from [Cesar De La Torre](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/Cesar+de+la+Torre+%5BMSFT%5D), so I had the chance to explore in high detail multiple aspects the microservices architecture.

Having worked some significant time on the e-book's reference application: [eShopOnContainers on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers), continuing with the e-book's content revision and my former life experience as the co-founder of a Venezuelan ISV, producer of a medium-sized (~600 database tables) Oracle ERP, I'm convinced that Microservices are not for everyone.

You should apply a Microservices Architecture when it's completely justified from a business point of view, for sure, as it solves some real life problems of large code bases and deployments. But it also adds **significant** complexity for both development and administration. So, be thoughtful and don't get caught in fashion moves.

So I decided to create this personal budget sample application, beginning with a monolith approach, but architected in a way that could be "easily" and progressively migrated to microservices when it becomes so successful it gets to compete with [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/) ðŸ˜‰.

You can get the "Microservices e-book" from several sources, as of 14-OCT-2018, the English PDF the most up-to-date release:

* PDF
  * English (The original): [.NET Microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications](https://aka.ms/microservicesebook)
  * Spanish (Hand-translated): [Microservicios .NET: Arquitectura para aplicaciones .NET contenerizadas](https://aka.ms/microservicesebook-es-es)

* ON-LINE
  * English/Automatic translation: [.NET Microservices: Architecture for containerized .NET applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/)
